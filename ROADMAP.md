# **NotificationService Roadmap**

This document outlines the planned features, enhancements, and improvements for the **NotificationService** project. The goal is to enhance email delivery capabilities with a focus on scalability, reliability, and maintainability using **AWS SES**.

---

## **Planned Features and Enhancements**

### **1. Improved RabbitMQ Integration**

**Objective**: Enhance scalability and fault tolerance in email request processing.

- **Implementation**:
    - Introduce **message prioritization** to ensure critical emails are processed first.
    - Implement **retry logic** for temporary failures, such as AWS SES downtime.
    - Configure **dead-letter queues** (DLQ) to handle undeliverable messages, enabling troubleshooting and reprocessing.
    - Apply backoff strategies to retry failed messages intelligently, reducing strain on the system during high-load periods.

- **Expected Outcome**:
    - Enhanced reliability and scalability of the email pipeline.
    - Reduced failure rates, with robust mechanisms for troubleshooting and retrying messages.
    - More efficient handling of high-load scenarios.

### **2. Enhanced Logging and Monitoring**

**Objective**: Improve visibility and provide robust troubleshooting tools for email delivery.

- **Implementation**:
    - Integrate **centralized logging** using solutions like the ELK stack or Datadog for tracking delivery events, failures, and retries.
    - Enable **real-time monitoring** of RabbitMQ queues, email delivery threads, and AWS SES usage rates.
    - Configure **alerts** for critical issues, such as exceeding AWS SES limits or queue build-up.
    - Introduce dashboards for key metrics like email delivery success rate, retry counts, and SES throttling.

- **Expected Outcome**:
    - Improved operational visibility for system administrators.
    - Faster resolution of issues through proactive monitoring and detailed insights.
    - Increased reliability through early detection of bottlenecks or failures.

### **3. Automated Email Prioritization**

**Objective**: Ensure efficient processing of emails based on their importance.

- **Implementation**:
    - Automate categorization of emails into priority levels (e.g., transactional > promotional).
    - Implement **queue filtering** to ensure critical emails are processed first during high load.
    - Allow dynamic re-prioritization of queued emails based on predefined rules.

- **Expected Outcome**:
    - Improved service quality for essential communications, such as password resets or payment confirmations.
    - Smarter resource allocation during peak usage periods.
    - Enhanced flexibility in managing different types of email traffic.

---

### **4. Scalable Email Quota Management**

**Objective**: Maintain compliance with AWS SES limits while maximizing throughput.

- **Implementation**:
    - Develop a **rate-limiting mechanism** to ensure email-sending rates remain within AWS SES quotas.
    - Dynamically adjust email-sending rates based on SES feedback (e.g., throttling signals).
    - Integrate SES quota monitoring into dashboards to provide visibility into usage trends.

- **Expected Outcome**:
    - Prevention of rate-limit violations and associated delivery delays.
    - Increased email throughput while maintaining compliance with SES constraints.
    - Enhanced scalability to support growing email volumes.

---

### **5. "Resend Failed Emails" Feature**

**Objective**: Provide administrators with the ability to retry failed email deliveries easily.

- **Implementation**:
    - Create a **retry interface** in the admin dashboard to allow failed emails to be re-sent manually.
    - Integrate with the dead-letter queue to retrieve failed messages for reprocessing.
    - Provide detailed failure logs to assist in understanding why the initial attempt failed.

- **Expected Outcome**:
    - Streamlined recovery from email delivery failures.
    - Reduced time to resolution for critical email delivery issues.
    - Enhanced control over email retries for administrators.

---

## **Development and Deployment Milestones**

### **Q1 2025:**
- Implement **message prioritization**, **retry logic**, and **dead-letter queues** in RabbitMQ.
- Begin work on **centralized logging** and **real-time monitoring**.

### **Q2 2025:**
- Complete **centralized logging** and integrate **real-time monitoring dashboards**.
- Deploy advanced **email prioritization** and queuing mechanisms.
- Implement **rate-limiting** and **retry interface** for failed emails.

### **Q3 2025:**
- Finalize the **retry interface** and improve **email quota management** and SES monitoring.
- Launch admin dashboard for monitoring and controlling email flows.
